    <img src="mirsarai 1.jpg" alt="Mirsharai landscape">
    <p>Mirsharai, an upazila in Chattogram District of Chattogram Division, Bangladesh, is a region rich in history and natural beauty. Spanning an area of 482.88 square kilometers, it is bordered by Tripura State of India and various upazilas, with the Bay of Bengal to its south. Historically, it came under Muslim rule in 1340 AD when Sultan Fakhruddin Mobarak Shah conquered Chittagong, and it later saw governance by rulers like Paragal Khan and Nizam Shah. The area is known for its revolutionary past, particularly during the British era and the 1971 Liberation War, with significant battles fought near Fenafuni Bridge. Today, Mirsharai attracts visitors with its scenic landscapes, including Khoiyachora Waterfall, Mohamaya Lake, and Bawachhora Lake, making it a growing tourist destination. With a population of around 398,716 and an average literacy rate of 55.08%, it also hosts educational institutions like Nizampur Government College and is developing economically with the Mirsharai Special Economic Zone.</p>

    <p>Khoiyachora Waterfall, located in the hills of Mirsharai Upazila in Chattogram, Bangladesh, is a stunning natural attraction often dubbed the "Queen of Waterfalls." This majestic waterfall features multiple cascades, with estimates ranging from seven to nine major tiers, each adding to its captivating beauty. Nestled amidst lush greenery, it offers a serene escape and an adventurous trekking experience, with the hike to the falls taking about 1.5 to 2 hours depending on the trail conditions. The best time to visit is during the monsoon season (June to October), when the water flow is at its peak, though the trails can become slippery. The surrounding area includes natural pools and scenic landscapes, making it a popular spot for nature lovers and photographers. Access involves traveling from Dhaka or Chattogram to Baratakia Bazar, followed by a trek from the nearby village.</p>

    <p>Mohamaya Lake, located in Durgapur Union of Mirsarai Upazila, Chattogram, Bangladesh, is the second-largest artificial lake in the country, covering about 11 square kilometers. Situated just 2 km east of Thakurdighi Bazar, it lies at the foot of hills and is a key part of the Mohamaya Irrigation Project, initiated in 2007-2008 and completed in 2009. The lake, surrounded by lush hills, crystal-clear waters, mountain caves, rubber dams, and seasonal waterfalls, offers a serene environment ideal for boating, kayaking, and camping. Managed partly by the Bangladesh Water Development Board, its water supports irrigation in nearby areas. The best time to visit is after the monsoon for lively waterfalls or in winter for kayaking and hiking. Accessible from Dhaka or Chattogram via bus or train to Thakurdighi Bazar, it’s a growing eco-tourism spot with no nearby hotels, though Sitakunda offers accommodation options.</p>
